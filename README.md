## Zalora Platform

Converge diverse software development and deployment practices under
an interface that lets developers and operations reuse
effort and write code that can be evaluated to a cloud or on-premise
deployment for various backends (VirtualBox, Docker containers, AWS
EC2, managed hosting environments, etc).

Zalora Platform uses Nix for expressing deployment topologies and packaging software
using the [Nix package manager](http://nixos.org/nix/).
Other platform-related work is available as [Defnix](https://github.com/zalora/defnix)
and [Upcast](https://github.com/zalora/upcast).
